//The organizers of the big event where Mugatu presented his design are trying to gather information about the
// visitors to make important future business decisions.
//
//Define the isBringingAPet function that asks whether a person is bringing a pet and returns a boolean with the answer.
//Define the isWearingAHat function that asks whether a person is wearing a hat and returns a boolean with the answer.
//Define the isAdult function that asks whether a person is 18 or older and returns a boolean with the answer.
//Define the hasChildren function that asks whether a person has children and returns a boolean with the answer.
//Define the visitors list with the getVisitorList function.
//Write code that the event organizers run to count how many visitors are adults, how many are bringing a pet,
//how many are wearing a hat and how many have children, printing out the statistics like the example below.
//
//-- Event organizerâ€™s statistics:
//
//A total of 732 visitors attended the event.
//From those, 310 (42%) were wearing a hat.
//From those, 258 (35%) were bringing a pet.
//From those, 521 (71%) were adults.
//From those, 362 (49%) were parents.
